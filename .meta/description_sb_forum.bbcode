A [URL='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006558650']My Enternia[/URL] patch that makes it compatible with the [URL='https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=731220462']Enhanced Storage[/URL] mod.

Note that while all (currently 36) containers are supported, not all follow the basic formula generally used for ES containers. This is primarily because [B]altas have extra reinforced storage spaces, so had to sacrifice some/allow more space to account for air tightness, additional locks and bion composite layers, as well as other security aspects.[/B]

This mod requires both My Enternia and Enhanced Storage to work, obviously.
